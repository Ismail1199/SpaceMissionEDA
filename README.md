# SpaceMissionEDA
The exploration of outer space has long intrigued humanity, leading to the conceptualization and execution of interstellar and planetary missions. These space missions not only aim to study celestial bodies but also pave the way for potential colonization, scientific advancement, and discovery of new resources. With increasing investment in space programs, understanding the metrics that define mission success becomes crucial. This report undertakes a deep exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a futuristic space mission dataset to uncover insights into mission planning and execution.

The dataset simulates missions that took place over a period of five months in the year 2025, detailing information such as mission objectives, launch vehicles, targeted celestial bodies, resource consumption, and scientific outcomes. By analyzing this data, we can assess which types of missions tend to be more successful, which target destinations are most frequent, and how factors like cost, duration, and crew size influence mission yield and success rates.

Beyond offering a numerical perspective, this EDA also emphasizes visual and statistical exploration. Through the application of various statistical methods, including hypothesis testing and inferential analysis, we aim to validate relationships within the data. We delve into tests such as chi-square, t-tests, and z-tests to examine the significance of the patterns observed. At the same time, we use visualizations like heatmaps, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to effectively communicate these insights and trends.

This introductory section sets the stage for a broader analytical journey. Through the subsequent sections, we employ statistical testing, visualization, and numerical analysis to extract meaningful patterns from the data. The ultimate objective is to enhance our understanding of mission performance indicators and offer insights that could assist in the planning of real-world space explorations in the future.
